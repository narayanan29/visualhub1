        <p>Cat activities should engage their natural instincts to hunt, stalk, and pounce, using interactive play with wand toys, feather teasers, and laser pointers. Other enriching activities include puzzles, climbing trees, catnip toys, hide-and-seek, leash walks, and DIY cardboard boxes or tunnels to provide both <q>physical exercise and mental stimulation</q>.
